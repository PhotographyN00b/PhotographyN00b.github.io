<p>
So now that you have bought the camera, the first step is to set it up.
These were the contents of the box containing the camera I purchased, which are the minimum requirements for photography:

   1. The camera 
   2. An 18-55 mm IS II Lens
   3. The battery along with the charger
   4. A 4 GB 30 MB/s memory card
   5. A Lens cover
