So now that you have bought the camera, the first step is to set it up.
These were the contents of the box containing the camera I purchased, which are the minimum requirements for photography:

   1. The camera 
   2. An 18-55 mm IS II Lens
   3. The battery along with the charger
   4. A 4 GB 30 MB/s memory card
   5. A Lens cover

First you fit the lens into the camera. There are white markings on the lens and the camera. Place the lens on the camera, with the markings in contact as per the image below  :

Then rotate the lens clockwise till you hear a soft click, which means that the lens is now in its place.

Then, you insert the memory card which will store all the photographs that you click, and then the charged battery.
The slots for the memory card and the battery in my camera are at the base.
