Hey there!

Welcome to Photography N00b!
Before I begin about the blog, this blog post is about a quick introduction about me and why I created this blog.

Hi! I&rsquo;m Akshay Kothari, currently a jobless bum with small amounts of interests in lots of things. 
And that&rsquo;s all about me!

About this blog, it&rsquo; because I recently bought a Canon 1100D and have been clicking picture with the trial and error method, which, well, sucks.
So I looked around the internet and got overwhelmed with the huge amount of information that is out there. It gets confusing!

So I&rsquo;ve decided to pick one aspect of the camera, research about it and put up a post about it over here.

If you have another DSLR camera, and want to contribute, you are welcome!
If you want me to put up step by step guides for other DSLR cameras as well, please send in the money or the camera, and I will do it for you :D :P

Anyways, nice to see you here. Hope you find this blog useful.

Cheers!
