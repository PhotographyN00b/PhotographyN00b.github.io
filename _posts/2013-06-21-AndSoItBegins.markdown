title: And So it Begins
---

Hey there! 
Welcome to PhotographyN00b! I intend to use this blog to create a step-by-step guide to basic photography as I learn it myself.

To begin with, let me introduce myself.
I'm Akshay Kothari, an ex-SAP consultant who used to work in a very reputed MNC, currently jobless and looking for business startup opprotunities.

Photography is a hobby and I have recently bought a Canon 1100D DSLR camera.

Till now I have mostly clicked pics with the camera using trial and error methods, but I'm interested in knowing what exactly I'm doing with the settings instead of randomly trying some setting, so I've decided to learn it step by step as I blog along. 

Hope you find this blog useful.

Suggestions, criticism, support and encouragement are always welcome!

Cheers! :)
