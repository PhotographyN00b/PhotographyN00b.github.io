So now that you have bought the camera, the first step is to set it up.
These were the contents of the box containing the camera I purchased, which are the minimum requirements for photography:
 
   1. The camera  
   2. An 18-55 mm IS II Lens 
   3. The battery along with the charger 
   4. A 4 GB 30 MB/s memory card 
   5. A Lens cover

First you fit the lens into the camera. There are white markings on the lens and the camera. Place the lens on the camera, with the markings in contact as per the image below  :

Then rotate the lens clockwise till you hear a soft click, which means that the lens is now in its place.

Then, you insert the memory card which will store all the photographs that you click, and then the charged battery.
The slots for the memory card and the battery in my camera are at the base.

So we inserted the memory card and the battery

Now that all the parts are in place, we are good to go.

ust switch on the camera, and click away!
In my case, we just needed to turn the dial from “Off” to “On”

Usually, a protective cap comes along with the lens, which you should use to cover the lens whenever you are not using the camera. This would help protect your lens from scratches and dust.

I have switched my lens from AF (Auto Focus) to MF (Manual Focus).

Now that the camera is ready, you can go ahead and take some photographs to test it out! 
In the next few posts, we would cover some of the various features of the camera, before we move on with the photography.
