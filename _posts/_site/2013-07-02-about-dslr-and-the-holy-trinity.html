<p>So DSLR stands for Digital Single Lens Reflex, which means that the light travels through a single lens and a mirror is used to reflect the light to the viewfinder. As a result, the camera captures the image exactly as you see it through the viewfinder.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to get into further details over here, as the scope of this blog is more about shooting photographs than about the workings of a DSLR camera but if you are curious, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_single-lens_reflex_camera'>Wikipedia</a> has a very informative page about it.</p>

<p>Moving on, we come to the Holy Trinity, knowledge of which is a must if you want to shoot quality photographs.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry, I&#39;m not about to start preaching about Christianity over here. The holy trinity in the world of photography are :</p>

<p>1. The Aperture<br /> 2. The Shutter Speed<br /> 3. The ISO speed</p>

<p>Now, all three of these are used to control only one thing â€“ the amount of light that makes it into the camera.</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s take a quick look at each of them:</p>

<h3 id='the_aperture'>The Aperture</h3>

<p>The Aperture (Also called the f-number) is a hole in the lens through which the light travels before it hits the camera.</p>

<p>If the aperture is large, it means more light enters the camera. This results in a brighter image. However, the image is sharp only around whatever the camera was focussing on. The rest of the image is blurred.</p>

<p>If the aperture is small, it means that lesser light enters the camera. This results in a somewhat reduced brightness. However, the image is sharper.</p>

<h3 id='the_shutter_speed'>The Shutter Speed</h3>

<p>The shutter speed is the speed with which the shutter opens and closes, thus determining the amount of time the sensor is exposed to light.</p>

<h3 id='the_iso'>The ISO</h3>

<p>With ISO, you can adjust the sensitivity of the image sensor to light. A lower ISO means that the sensor is less sensitive. This means that it would require more light to capture a brighter image. However, it would also result in a sharper image. A higher ISO would mean that the camera is more sensitive to light and would need less exposure to light to capture a bright image. This would however, result in a less sharp and more grainy image.</p>

<p>If you are taking pictures outdoors, you might want to use low ISO (100 should be good). However, if you are taking pictures indoors, or in low lighting, you might want to increase the ISO.</p>

<p>Of course, I will not be following any general rule to what combinations of the Holy Trinity to use in various conditions while taking my photographs as I think that each situation is unique and the moment defines the combination that I want to use.</p>

<p>In the upcoming blog posts, I will be experimenting with each of the settings and combinations of the Holy Trinity to obtain different results.</p>

<p>This is where we start off with actually using the camera and taking photographs! :)</p>
