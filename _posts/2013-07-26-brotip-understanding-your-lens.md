If you are using a DSLR or even a simple point and shoot lens chances are you have seen some really
confusing numbers written on it. What do these numbers mean and how are they relevant to the kind of
shot you are taking.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/akshaykothari/9366958031/" title="Picture 1 by akshaykothari, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7330/9366958031_c80d268b56.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="Picture 1"></a>

__Focal Length__ – This tells use the range of focal length(s) that the lens supports. In this case anything
from 18mm to 55mm.

__Aperture__ – This tells us the maximum aperture values of the lens at various focal lengths. In this case the
lens will have a max aperture of f/3.5 when the focal length is 18mm and a max aperture of f/5.6 when the
focal length is 55mm. The minimum aperture in both cases will be f/22 which can be selected when you
click the picture in manual mode.

__Image Stabilization__ – states the lens has image stabilization which when turned on will try to remove any
handshake movements that you might impart while clicking a picture. This is done optically and hence it is
generally a good idea to leave on but drains battery so if you are using a tripod turns it off.

__Filter Diameter__ - refers to the diameter of the filter ring. If you want to put say a UV filter or a ND filter you
will have to get one matching this number on the lens or it will not fit.

__Type of lens__ – Zoom, Macro, Prime, Fish-Eye, Pan-Tilt, Etc.

Now if you have been using talking to someone who owns a DSLR you probably would have
heard the term prime lens or a zoom lens. What does this mean? A prime lens is a lens that has a
single focal length (say 50mm) while a zoom lens is a lens with multiple focal length (say 70 to
300mm).You must be wondering why in the world someone would buy a prime lens over a zoom
lens. Well yes the zoom lens does give you a lot of versatility on how you want to shoot but they
are also expensive as it has a lot of moving parts that cause loss of image quality and in most
cases the max aperture of a zoom is less compared to the corresponding prime lens. Prime
lenses are also lighter and so are easier to lug around. Which is better is matter of choice.

__Lens Mount Type__ - The kind of mount on your camera that this lens would fit into.

__Manufacturer__ - Who made the lens? Well Duh.

##More on Focal Length##

Focal length also tells you what amount of a particular scene you will be able to capture. Moving the lens
closer (shorter focal length) to the sensor gives you a wider field of view (as seen the video) while moving
the lens further away gives you a narrower field of view. Looking at the diagrams it is also clear that an
object when viewed through a longer focal length will appear bigger as it captures more area on the
sensor. This is basically how “zoom” works. View the moon through a 18mm lens and appears more like a
ping pong ball but using a 300 mm lens it actually looks like the moon.

Any lens that has a focal length equal (or close to) to the diagonal length of your sensor will be called as a
normal lens and is so called because it gives the image a look just similar to the way a human eye would
see it. Any lens with a focal length less than the diagonal length is called a wide angle lens. And anything
with a focal length higher will be called a telephoto lens.

So for example you have a camera with a 35mm sensor (diagonal length 43mm) then the lenses in the
range 35-50mm would be considered normal anything below 35 would be considered wide angle and
anything over 50 would be called telephoto. In order to get an image of a something to look “normal” we
would need a get a sensor that measures 43mm diagonal with a 43 (or close by) mm lens as in a DSLR
or we could get a 1mm sensor with a 1mm lens like your phone camera. That being said it is better to
have a bigger sensor size as it will have less noise in the final image and will have a better color
reproduction. I will write another post to explain the different ways the wide-angle-ness of telephoto-ness
of a lens can be used.

This is an image of the same scene taken from the same location using the same camera with different
focal lengths. Note how the 200 mm zooms into the scene and how the 18mm lens give you a very wide
angle of the scene. The tree in the 200mm scene is visible in the 18mm scene but is much smaller at it
occupies less space on the sensor/final image.
